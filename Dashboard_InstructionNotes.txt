MainInstructions
MAYBE I want this to be slightly dynamic based on selections (e.g. granular switch, crimefilter)
	
	Overview/Explanation (What are we showing)

	Explain each MAIN filter in regards to main map
		Year (easy)
		Minimap (easy)
		GranularSwitch - Geo LoD (needs renaming)
		CrimeFilter - Talk about effect on map and also how this determines lower graph
		HigherThanSwitch - Filtering out lower levels of crime (needs renaming)

	Explain selecting/hovering on the map itself (including tooltip info)

	Point out any erroneous combinations / problems [Need to find these and put here]
		'Weapons' in 2012/2013 includes public disorder
			due to change in police naming of categories
		Can select all regions on map... I don't want this but can't stop it so point it out
			e.g. 'It's possible for the regions to accidentally select all...
				if this happens, just click a single region on the minimap'
		Force Area (granularSwitch) expands outside region, explain this
			e.g. 'force areas don't line up perfectly to regions'


DynamicInstructions
MAYBE I want this to be even more dynamic for certain charts based on selections 
	(e.g. granular switch for deprivation graphs)

	Overview/Explanation (What are we showing)
		Drugs
			Switch variables on RIGHT axis as POINTS
				Deaths/Hospitalisations per drug user
			LEFT axis showing as BARS
				Number of Police Drug Seizures
		Violence & sexual crime
			Wales ranked seperately to England by government of Wales


	Describe LoD / links with map above (like selecting and stuff)

	Explain linked filters (no need to explain apart from its own special ones)
	
	Point out any erroneous combinations / problems [Need to find these and put here]
		Drugs
			No Hospitalisation points for 2012-13, starts at 14
			No showing London (too much of an outlier) and no Wales (no data)
		Weapons
			Force Area selection expands outside region
			Important to explain how this messes with stuff (Metropolitan Police)
				... and how to fix it (via map or point selection)
			Sometimes LABELS for force areas don't show up to avoid overlap
				... just point this out, tell them to hover or whatever
			NO TASER INCIDENTS for 2017
				.. point this out, no data
