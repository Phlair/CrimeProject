Violence&Sexual Sheet (DONE)
[violence and sexual crimes] VS [lsoa deprivation ranks]
	Carries over region value for crimes and dep ranks
	filterable by force area by selecting singular/multiple on main map
	filterable by LSOA by selecting singular/multiple on main map

	Carries over year value for crimes (also make sure outcomeflag=True)
	i.e. need to fix deprivation ranks as they don't have years (auto because used my fixednumber from before)

	Explain Wales in instructions (has its own ranks seperate to England)


Weapons Sheet (DONE)
[Firearm offences] VS [licensed firearms/dealers]
	Carries over year and region values for both
	filterable by selecting singular/multiple on main map
		will need to (MAYBE) write a special catch for granular selector that turns LSOA choice back into Region
